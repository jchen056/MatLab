% According to normal probability plots, female height data set, male height 
% data set, female weight data set, and male weight data set are normally distributed 
% because most data points are near the line.
% 
% Since female height data set, male height data set, female weight data set, 
% and male weight data set are normally distributed, parametric statistical methods 
% can be applied to test for difference(see the normal probability plots combined 
% in the last section).
